# calcParser-himadriali

you can install this project by issuing the following command:
```
stack install
```

When installation is succesful and complete, look for the following lines:

```
Copied executables to /..SOME_PATH../bin:
- calcParser-exe
```

You should be able to call the executable:

```
- /..SOME_PATH../bin/calcParser-exe
```

### Plans:

You can find our github repo here: https://github.com/himadrin/calcParser


### Question:
Do we add the cabal file to our git repo even though it was automatically added to the .gitignore?
